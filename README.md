🚀 Problem-Solving Tasks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains two sets of programming challenges:
💻 C++ Tasks – Algorithmic problems to practice logic and implementation.
🐍 Python Tasks – Practical exercises focusing on Python features, libraries, and problem-solving skills.

💻 C++ Tasks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- 🥤 Orange Juice Cocktail
Mix equal parts of several drinks with given 🍊 juice percentages and calculate the percentage in the final mixture.

2- 🔢 Anton’s Favorite Integers
Use given counts of digits 2️⃣, 3️⃣, 5️⃣, and 6️⃣ to maximize the sum of 32 and 256.

3- 📏 Maximum GCD in a Range
Find the largest possible GCD among pairs (a, b) in the range 1 ≤ a < b ≤ n.

4- ➕➖ Diagonal Difference
Calculate the absolute difference between the sums of a square matrix’s ↘ primary and ↙ secondary diagonals.

5- 🍏🍊 Apples and Oranges
Count how many apples 🍏 and oranges 🍊 fall on Sam’s house 🏠 given tree positions and fruit fall distances.

🐍 Python Tasks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- 🤖 Chat Bot
A chatbot that remembers your name ✍️, performs ➕➖ arithmetic, and handles unknown queries using dictionaries 📚 and lists 📝.

2- 🎯 Maximize It
Pick one element from each of K lists 📋 to maximize (sum of squares) % M.

3- 🔐 Key Password Generator
Generate a secure password 🔑 with uppercase 🔠, lowercase 🔡, digits 🔢, and special characters ✨.

4- 🖼 Image Editing with Pillow
Load an image 📷, turn its left quarter ⬅️ black 🖤, and save it.

5- 📜 Matrix Script Decoder
Read a matrix 📊 column-wise, replace non-alphanumeric gaps with spaces, and output the decoded message 🗣.

🧩 OOP Task
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- 🔍 Shallow vs Deep Copy (Python)
Explain the difference between shallow and deep copying with examples. Show how shared references in shallow copy can affect the original object, while deep copy creates fully independent copies.

2- 🏛 Multiple Inheritance (Python)
Describe and demonstrate multiple inheritance. Cover what happens when a child overrides a parent method, when two parents have the same method, and when two parents share the same grandparent (diamond problem).

3- 🗳 Voting System with Encapsulation (Python)
Create a voting system using OOP principles. Implement methods to add candidates, remove candidates, cast votes, and display the winner, ensuring data is hidden using encapsulation.

4- 📱 Smartphone Class with Multiple Inheritance (Python)
Build a smartphone class that inherits from a Phone class (add/remove contacts, make calls) and a Camera class (take pictures). Demonstrate multiple inheritance in action.
